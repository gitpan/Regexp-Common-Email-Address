NAME
    Regexp::Common::Email::Address - Returns a pattern for Email Addresses

SYNOPSIS
      use Regexp::Common qw[Email::Address];
      use Email::Address;

      while (<>) {
          my (@found) = /($RE{Email}{Address})/g;
          my (@addrs) = map $_->address,
                            Email::Address->parse("@found");
          print "X-Addresses: ",
                join(", ", @addrs),
                "\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
  $RE{Email}{Address}
    Provides a regex to match email addresses as defined by RFC 2822. Under
    "{-keep}", the entire match is kept as $1. If you want to parse that
    further then pass it to "Email::Address->parse()". Don't worry, it's
    fast.

    Email::Address, Regexp::Common, perl.
